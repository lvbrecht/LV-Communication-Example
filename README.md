# LV-Communication-Example
An example to show how to communicate with the strength calculation of pressure vessels (AD, EN, ASME) from Lauterbach via server. 
The example can also be applied to the Lauterbach software for thermal design of heat exchangers (shell and tube, coils etc.).

The Class LVCommunicator contains the actual server. The LVCommunicator class is just a simplified approach which does all the necessary
things the server needs to do, to successfully communicate with us.
